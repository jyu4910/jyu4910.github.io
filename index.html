        <p>Hello World!</p>
        <p>
            My name is Jack, and I'm currently a Business Intelligence Analyst at Sutter Health, supporting the Internal Audit department.
        </p>
        <p>
            During undergrad, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do for my career. My older sister suggested majoring in Data Science since it 
            was a new major at UC Berkeley at the time. I figured, why not? So, I enrolled in an intro to Data Science course - and I'm 
            glad I did. I really enjoyed the analytics side of it, which ultimately convinced me to stick with the major. I went on to earn 
            a BA in Data Science from UC Berkeley.
        </p>
        <p>
            After graduation, I joined Businessolver as a Product Manager Intern on the Sofia team, which manages a chatbot that answers 
            users' benefits questions. I wrote bug and enhancement tickets, conducted basic data analysis to identify areas for improvement,
            and uploaded quarterly reports for clients. I was later offered a full-time role as an Associate Product Manager, where I took
            on additional responsibilities like managing a shared inbox, collaborating with technical teams, testing new features, and writing
            complex SQL queries to evaluate user engagement. Within a year, I was promoted to Product Manager Technical I, where I led a 
            dependent audit project from start to finish for a major client, resulting in millions of dollars in operational cost savings.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I enjoyed my time in product management, I found myself drawn back to data analysis. That led me to pursue analyst roles 
            and eventually land my current position. I'm now also pursuing an MS in Analytics part-time at Georgia Tech to continue growing 
            my skill set. If you'd like to connect, feel free to reach out at jyu663@gatech.edu!
